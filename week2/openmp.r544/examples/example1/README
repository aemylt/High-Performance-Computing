We begin our OpenMP examples with, of course, the quintessential, "hello, world" program.

OpenMP is available to C, C++ and Fortran programmers.  Accordingly, I've include C and
Fortran90 versions in this directory.  These can be contrasted with a similar program
written using POSIX threads directly.

Type 'make' to create the executables.  I have also included a submission script for use
on the cluster.
