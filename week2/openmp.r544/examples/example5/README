This directory contains two example programs.  One to sort a list using quicksort,
and an accelerated version which uses the OpenMP 'sections' directive.  Since quicksort
is a recursive algorithm, the accelertated version spawns pairs of threads (working on 
sublists) also in a recursive manner.

Exercise
========

quicksort
---------

Determine whether the time to sort a list increases linearly as the list size grows.  

quicksort_sections
------------------

Invesigate the effect of varying free parameters such as the LOW_LIMIT or the number
of threads.  Plot a few data points for your free parameters against list size and
your reference serial program.

Do compiler flags effect your findings?

Can you think of any ways to improve the threaded version?
