This example directory and the next focus on work-sharing loops--the mainstay of OpenMP programming.

simple
======

This program envokes the default work sharing algorithm.
The output from the program shows how the loop iterattions are
distributed between the cores.  On my laptop, I get two large
contiguous sets of iterations executed by the two cores.

schedule
========

In this program, we change the work-sharing pattern an explicitly
ask that the work be distributed in chunks of ten loop iterations.
