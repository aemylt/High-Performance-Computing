Welcome to the MPI programming examples!

In this directory we start, again, with "hello, world."
MPI libraries can be used with several languages.  Here
we have programs written in C, C++, Fortran77 and Fortran90.

**NB**  Loading multiple MPI related modules could cause
unpredictable behaviour and runtime errors (as mpirun from
one module can end up being called with executables created
with compilers from another).

For simplicity just load the:

  base/infiniband-gcc
and
  tools/tau-2.21.1-mpi
modules.
