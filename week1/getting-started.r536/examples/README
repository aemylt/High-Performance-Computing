# ===============
# Getting started
# ===============
#
# This tarball contains three examples.  The first two provide some practice
# in submitting jobs to the cluster's queueing system.  You will need to use
# the queuing system for much of your practical work on the course.
#
# In order to run the first two examples, you will need to have the following
# modules loaded:

torque/2.5.5
maui/3.3.1
base/infiniband-gcc

# You can do this by putting:

module add torque/2.5.5
module add maui/3.3.1
module add base/infiniband-gcc

# in your ~/.bashrc file, for example.

# Both of the submission scripts send your jobs to the 'veryshort' queue.
# To submit a job:

qsub job_submit

# To look at the queue:

showq | less

# (hit 'q' to quit from less.)
# The third example gives some practice in optimising serial code.  It covers
# topics such as compiler flags, profiling tools and the choice of algorithm itself.
